            <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                Vietnamese food is known to be both healthy and robust in flavour, thanks its generous combination of
                fresh herbs and greens, paired with rice, noodles, seafood, pork and beef. While many cities such as
                Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City offer plenty of fine-dining venues and five-star hotel restaurants decked out
                in extravagant settings, some of the best (and most authentic) Vietnamese delicacies are actually found
                at roadside eateries, vibrant street markets, and humble-looking restaurants.

                <img class="rounded" src="../image/food/pho-10dish.jpg" alt="">
                <p>
                    Phở is the quintessential Vietnamese dish, the word phở referring to the type of noodle used in the
                    recipe. Flat rice noodles dance around with medium-rare slivers of beef or boiled chicken in a
                    hearty beef stock. The more popular of the two widely known varieties is phở Hanoi. Originally from
                    the north, it is distinguished by a clear broth and dressed only with a squeeze of lemon and slices
                    of bird’s eye chili. The southern iteration, phở Nam, has a murkier broth and is served with a
                    bouquet of fresh herbs like bean sprouts, basil and mint.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The secret to a good bowl of phở lies in its stock. The broth is usually infused with fragrant star
                    anise, clove and cinnamon to lend a natural sweetness to the mix. This dish is found on almost every
                    street corner and is actually consumed for breakfast, unbeknownst to outsiders.

                <img class="rounded" src="../image/food/banhmi.jpg" alt="">
                <p>
                    Banh mi was first introduced to Vietnam during the French colonial period. It is a modification of
                    the baguette, which was a staple food of the French in the 19th century. The baguette, paired with
                    pork pâté, ham, cheese, and butter to serve only the French colonists at expensive restaurants and
                    cafes, was still a luxury product to most Vietnamese.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the locals learned how to make this food themselves, Banh mi became a common product, like
                    other Western products such as condensed milk, coffee, and beer. The bakeries opened one after
                    another in Saigon, some of which served the local class' need and became a hit, making Banh Mi the
                    favorite breakfast to the Vietnamese until now.

                <p>
                    Back in the day, Vietnamese farmers would eat the fractured rice grains they could not sell.
                    Nowadays, “broken” rice is a food staple for the everyday working-class citizen. For a meal of
                    humble origins, the preparations for cơm tấm can get very decadent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While it's prepared in a number of ways, the most popular is cơm tấm sườn nướng ốp la. A fried egg
                    is paired with caramelised grilled pork chop and laid out on a generous heap of broken rice. The
                    dish is then slathered with nước chấm, a mixture of chilli, fish sauce and sugar, and a drizzle of
                    green onion oil. The final touches include a side of shredded pickled carrots and daikon, slices of
                    cucumbers and tomatoes, and crushed fried pork rinds and shallots for garnish.

                <img class="rounded" src="../image/food/bunboHue.jpg" alt="">
                <p>
                    Representing the legendary royal cuisine of Hue, bún bò huế is a mighty demonstration of both beauty
                    and taste. The alarmingly red broth is the first signal of its striking flavour—the result of hours
                    spent simmering beef bones and stalks of lemongrass to produce a citrusy concoction. Flash boiled
                    vegetables paired with tender beef shanks give this dynamic affair added vivacity. This may be a
                    beef soup—the word bò is Vietnamese for beef—but don’t be surprised when you see sausage lurking in
                    the bowl. Chả lụa is a sausage made of ham paste that has a texture reminiscent of tofu.

                <p>
                    Part soup, part salad, mì quảng gracefully pulls off an identity crisis. That being said, don’t let
                    the elegance of mì quảng fool you. This light and springy noodle dish from the Quang Nam province in
                    Central Vietnam is street food. The vibrantly yellow noodles owe their rich colour to the
                    turmeric-infused broth made rich with peanut oil. Only a ladleful is used in the making of this
                    “soup”, which can be topped with anything from shrimp and chicken to pork belly and snakehead fish.
                    Eat mì quảng with sliced banana flowers, Vietnamese coriander, basil and bánh tráng me, toasted
                    sesame rice crackers.

                <p>
                    A Mekong Delta creation, bánh xèo is widely eaten around south and central Vietnam. Watching the
                    crispy crepe being assembled is an audio-visual experience: the batter crackles loudly when it hits
                    the hot pan—xèo meaning sizzling—and the edges gradually curl and golden as the skilled xèo maker
                    deftly swirls the pan to evenly spread out the dense batter. The batter, traditionally made from
                    rice flour and coconut milk, owes its yellowish hue to the addition of turmeric. Another
                    French-inspired delight, the savoury pancake is filled with slices of boiled pork, minced pork, bean
                    sprouts and shrimp and then folded in the manner of a crepe. A bánh xèo shouldn’t be too soggy and
                    is best appreciated fresh off the skillet.

                    Bún chả became an overnight sensation after President Obama was pictured scarfing down a bowl of
                    these grilled pork patties with Anthony Bourdain. But this speciality of the Old Quarter in Hanoi
                    has always been popular among the locals. Around lunchtime, the scent of pork grilling over hot
                    charcoal wafts down the sidewalks, filling the noses of hungry Hanoians.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This classic northern dish is comprised of cold bún (rice vermicelli); slices of seasoned pork
                    belly; a mountain of fresh herbs and salad greens; and last but not least, medallions of minced pork
                    swimming in a bowl brimming with a fish sauce-based broth. The go-to approach is to scoop small
                    bundles of bún into your broth bowl and rotate between eating the noodles, the pork and the greens.

                    spoonful of creamy mung bean paste and toasted shrimps. The cakes are then trimmed with either
                    croutons or the more indulgent tép mỡ—crunchy fried pork fat. At the centre of a good bánh bèo
                    should be a dimple, signalling a well-steamed batch. This is paired nicely with nước chấm.

                    Bánh bột lọc is a transparent chewy dumpling made from tapioca flour and filled with minced pork and

                    This is a specialty of Hue, the old imperial city in central Vietnam. My family originated from Hue
                    so I grew up eating a lot of bánh bột lọc. This recipe is relatively easy but forming the dumpling
                    does take some practice. The boiled dumplings are worth the effort, and making the dumplings is a
                    fun activity to do as a group.
