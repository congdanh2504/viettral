            <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                Noodles are a much-loved and used ingredient in Vietnam. Whether they are served up in soups, form the
                base of a salad or are wrapped up in a fresh gỏi cuốn, they are a staple enjoyed in Saigon and
                everywhere else in the country morning, noon and night.
                However, to anyone new to the country, the sheer quantity and variety can be pretty overwhelming. To
                help ease the passage for the budding expat or bemused tourist, here’s a list of the different noodles
                in Vietnam and the dishes for which they are commonly used.

                <img class="rounded" class="rounded" src="../image/food/pho (1).jpg" alt="">
                <p>
                    Pho is the de-facto national dish of Vietnam and undoubtedly the most well-known Vietnamese dish
                    overseas. This noodle soup is made up of three components: a broth made by simmering beef bones and
                    herbs overnight to really bring the flavor out, fresh rice noodles and a type of meat—typically
                    beef.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite Hanoi being the birthplace of pho, it is found everywhere in Vietnam and the flavors change
                    from region to region as it does with most dishes. It also may be a common breakfast staple, yet
                    it’s almost impossible to not find it at all hours. Try it at least once in your life.

                <img class="rounded" src="../image/food/caolau.jpg" alt="">
                <p>
                    Cao lau is the most famous noodle dish from Hoi An. This roasted pork noodle dish cannot be found in
                    any other city, which is why it’s a must that you try it while you’re in Hoi An. The reason you
                    can’t make an authentic cao lau elsewhere is that the broth can only be made with water drawn from
                    the local Ba Le well. The origin story of this dish is still unknown.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This dish is made with noodles, pork, and local greens. Noodles of Cao Lau are carefully made from
                    local new sticky rice. It is hand-cut and then cooked three times with firewood. It is invented by
                    the Chinese but similar to Japanese wheat-based udon noodles. Water used to soak rice must be taken
                    from wells in the undisclosed ancient Cham well, just outside the town.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The pork is stir-fried, marinated in star anise and cassia bark. It is sliced thin and cooked in the
                    traditional Chinese method known as “Char siu”. Dry pancakes must be thick with much sesame on the
                    surface. Toppings include peanuts, and bean sprouts making this dish hard to resist. This dish is
                    eaten with lots of herbs and vegetables which greatly enhance its flavors. Cao Lau is surprisingly
                    unique dish in Hoi An.

                <img class="rounded" src="../image/food/bunrieu.jpg" alt="">
                <p>
                    Bun rieu is a seafood vermicelli soup with a distinctive crimson color thanks to the use of tomato
                    paste and annatto oil. Crab meat is the star of this noodle dish, but depending on the region, you
                    can find various takes such as the use of beef, pork or even snail. The dish is light, and well
                    balanced.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The interplay between crab and tomato makes bún riêu a truly standout dish. A hearty soup bursting
                    with acidity, the components of this meal include slippery bún, fresh crab meat, blocks of tofu and
                    stewed tomatoes. Cooking an authentic bowl of bún riêu is a labour-intensive process. After the crab
                    meat is separated from the body, the shell is then pulverized using a mortar and pestle and then
                    strained through to form the base of the broth. Floating around the bowl are pillowy clusters of
                    minced crab combined with ground pork and egg that melt in your mouth.

                <img class="rounded" src="../image/food/hutieu.jpg" alt="">
                <p>
                    This is the standard street food item in the south. The Vietnamese version of the kuy teav in
                    Cambodia and guay tiew in Thailand, hủ tiếu is a bowl of noodles served either wet (nước) or dry
                    (khô). Typically, an opaque broth made from pork bones is eaten with hủ tiếu noodles. The definitive
                    rendition of hủ tiếu is Hủ Tiếu Nam Vang. The recipe calls for pork on the bone, boiled liver, a
                    quail egg and some shrimp. If you’re squeamish, ask them to hold off on the congealed pork blood
                    chunks, which make their way into a bowl every now and then. The peppery broth speckled with chopped
                    green onions also has a noticeable sweetness to it, coming from the addition of rock sugar.

                <img class="rounded" src="../image/food/bundau.jpg" alt="">
                <p>
                    If your travel bucket list includes trying worldly cuisine, there should be room in it for bun dau
                    mam tom – Vietnamese fermented shrimp paste noodle. Sure, pho, bun cha, banh mi, banh xeo may be
                    among the most popular in Vietnam, but if you would like to try something a little more unique, then
                    bun dau mam tom should be in that list. We know it sounds a little unappetizing when we say
                    fermented shrimp paste noodle, but hopefully this article will be able to convince you as to why you
                    should try it at least once.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bun dau mam tom has no soup, and the components are served separately—vermicelli noodles, tofu, pork
                    and the star of the dish, the smelly mam tom sauce. Mam tom sauce is essentially fermented shrimp
                    paste and you can think of it like the vegemite of Vietnam—you’ll either love it or hate it. Squeeze
                    in some lime wedges into the sauce, and then use it to flavor the slabs of tofu and pork you eat
                    with the noodles.
