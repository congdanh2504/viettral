                craving

                    Many people say that when coming to Hue, you must have a cup of Che Hem. Located in a peaceful small
                    alley in the old capital, this sweet soup shop has existed for more than 2 decades and has become
                    the memory of many generations of students and students. Here, you can try the cool bean sweet food,
                    lumpy coconut filter powder or the famous roasted pork filter powder. So famous, but the service
                    here is not appreciated, so you may be a bit surprised when you visit.

                    Along Tran Hung Dao Street, there are a lot of sweet soup shop, but Ngoc Hien sweet soup is still
                    the most
                    crowded place. At first glance, visitors are easily "loved" by sweet soup cabinets with up to 20
                    eye-catching and extremely stimulating dishes. Sweet soup flavor has been changed to suit the
                    majority of guests, so it no longer retains the characteristics of Hue royal sweet soup. But no
                    matter what
                    kind of sweet soup is full of abundance and deliciousness, along with the price is also extremely
                    cute. The owner is enthusiastic, making clothes is also very fast and professional.

                    It is also a perennial sweet soup shop like Che Hem, but on the outside, Ong Lac sweet soup is much
                    simpler

                    a simple cup of sweet soup, sitting in the middle of the house in the alley, feeling like returning
                    to the day when he was a child with him and his grandmother in the countryside. Because there is no
                    signboard, if you do not pay close attention, you will find it difficult to find a shop. At this
                    point, do not hesitate to ask people for directions.
